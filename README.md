Those 2 files are console apps coded in python.

The first file fetches data from an API that is given by jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and displays the data on the console. It fetches posts, todos and photos from the API and display all or some of their filtered attributes depending on the need. It also asks you to input their IDs if you want to see a specific todo, post or photo.

The Second file fetches data from Anghamiâ€™s APIs and I use my own user token to fetch my own Data. It displays my liked songs, liked artists and liked albums that I get from their database through the API.
